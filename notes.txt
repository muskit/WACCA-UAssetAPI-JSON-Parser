Game files are in WindowsNoEditor/Mercury/Content.

./MusicData : Charts
	- folders are song IDs
	- .mer format (text-readable, UTF-8)

./Sound/Bgm : Various music (including levels')
	- all music appear to be stored in MER_BGM.awb (including some test audio)
		a. unpack using VGMToolbox
		b. resulting .bin files are in HCA format (decode with VGAudio, .bin files must end with .hca)
		c. songs (maybe all audio?) come in pairs: 1st is unaltered (headphones?), 2nd is eq'd (cab speakers?)
	- audio data's stored order might be same as ID?

./Table/MusicParameterTable.uasset
	- UAsset file; read stored DataTable with UAssetGUI (export to JSON and scrape)
	- contains song info (ID to name, artist, levels, etc.)
	- does not contain .hca offsets

https://wacca.marv.jp/music/ : Latest official song database (online)
	- inspect element to get ID of song
	- excludes songs removed over time
	- scrape the HTML

song db lines up with audio until HOT LIMIT (S01-008); its audio is present in game but is not in expected HCA position
